TABS - a light-weight data tracker 


INTRODUCTION 

Tabs, a working title, is intended to be a light-weight Laboratory
Information Management System (LIMS) 


HOME PAGE 

The landing page will remain relatively simple with a navigation bar,
simple text of your choosing, and a limited amount of the most recent news and
updates.  Naturally, news and updates have links to their expanded pages, as
does the navigation bar.  News and updates will also appear in the navigation
bar along with a link to home via "tabs" and "home" links, and a link to the
LIMS system, "tracker". The home page also has a footer with links to the Furey
Lab and University of North Carolina websites: http://fureylab.web.unc.edu/ and
http://www.unc.edu/, respectively.

DOCUMENTATION - /docs


NEWS - /news 

News give users the opportunity to posted related items of interest
related to the site, or data on the site.  As of now, no effort is taken or will
be taken to limit postings in scope.  The most recent news items are listed on
the home page, and in descending chronological order via /news.  Links are
provided on the home page.


NEWS ITEM - /news/1 

Users can view news items individually, where 1 in /news/1
can be replaced by the news identification number.  No effort will be taken to
turn this into a forum.


UPDATES - /updates 

Like with news, this functionality gives users the
opportunity to share items related to progress on samples, new site features, or
anything else that may be of interested and not included in news.  No effort has
or will be taken to separate news and updates contents.


UPDATES ITEM - /updates/1 

See section NEWS ITEM.


NEWS AND/OR UPDATES 

It is entirely possible, now or in the future, that these
two sections be combined, as they are already had to distinguish in scope.
